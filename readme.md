# Rate variation in virus

1. Get beast highest clade credibility tree from beast.

2. Reroot all ML trees such that the slope is positive and has a low R<sup>2</sup> Check the regressions, if they look terrible, we might need to remove some taxa and re do them. We should plot all of these.

3. Check date-randomisations. I have some R code from my bacteria project to plot these, which we can reuse. The first step, however, is to have a quick look in tracer.

4. Plot histograms of the ucld.mean and ucld.stdev. I suspect the data sets with no temporal structure have ucld.means with very low values, as if they bumped against zero. The ucld.stdev should 'bump against zero' if the data have are clocklike.

5. We need a GitHub repository with all the fasta files, accession numbers, and xml files. This can be done within half an hour.
